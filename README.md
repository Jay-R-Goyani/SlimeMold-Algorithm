# SlimeMold-Algorithm
The project explores optimizing urban and rural networks, inspired by <b> Slime Molds </b> like <i> Physarum Polycephalum </i>. Inefficient networks hinder development, but slime molds efficiently create optimal networks. Their resemblance to Japan's metro network led to the Slime Mold Algorithm (SMA), offering a novel solution to network optimization.<br>
